js-minimal-android-swipe-detect
===============================

Minimal JS object for detecting touch/swipe via a callback function with arguments: direction and distance.
Only fired on touchend.
Works on PC/mac browsers as well.
Currently only tested on Chrome, FF, IE8, IE9, Android 4.2


var s = new uiSwipe( function( direction, distance ){
  
  /**
   * direction is in radians
   * 
   * 
   * 
   * 
   * 
  
});

s.pause();  // not yet implemented
s.resume(); // not yet implemented
